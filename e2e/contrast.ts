/**
 * Composite-aware WCAG 1.4.3 contrast measurement.
 *
 * This exists because axe is not a complete contrast oracle. Two classes of
 * text never reach the `violations` array a gate asserts on:
 *
 *  - text over a surface axe declines to resolve. Every dramatic surface in
 *    this lab is one: `.hex-output` is `rgba(0,0,0,0.4)` over the panel,
 *    `.attack-overlay` is `rgba(255,45,45,0.05)`, the "why this matters"
 *    notice is `rgba(255,170,0,0.05)`, the attack theater's "YOUR MOVE"
 *    callout is `rgba(255,0,0,0.04)`, `--green-glow` / `--red-glow` are
 *    translucent again, and the hero aside is a `color-mix(in oklab, …)`.
 *    axe files those nodes under `incomplete` rather than measuring them, so a
 *    gate asserting only on `violations` never sees the ink the whole exhibit
 *    is painted in.
 *  - text faded by an ancestor's `opacity` — axe reads the declared `color`,
 *    which is not the colour that lands on screen. Here that is `.cl-hero-sub`
 *    at `.85`, and `body`'s own `crt-flicker` keyframes, which dip the entire
 *    document to `opacity: 0.97` on a 4s loop for anyone who has not asked for
 *    reduced motion.
 *
 * So: walk every element that owns text, composite the real painted result
 * (translucent colours, gradient stops and opacity groups included), and
 * compute the ratio against the surface the text is genuinely sitting on
 * rather than against white.
 *
 * Opacity is modelled the way the compositor actually does it: an element with
 * `opacity < 1` renders its subtree into a group, then composites the group
 * over the backdrop. That means the *text* and the *background beside it* fade
 * onto the same backdrop independently — which is why both are carried through
 * the walk as a pair rather than fading the foreground alone.
 *
 * The ancestor walk is geometry-aware, because DOM ancestry is not the same
 * thing as "painted underneath". An absolutely positioned child can render
 * entirely outside its parent's box, and then the parent's background is simply
 * not behind it. So an ancestor's own paint is applied only when its border box
 * actually intersects the text's box; a partial intersection still counts, so
 * the judgement stays worst-case. Opacity is unconditional either way — an
 * opacity group fades its whole subtree wherever that subtree happens to paint.
 *
 * Three things this page forced on top of that, each of which otherwise makes
 * the helper report a ratio nothing on screen has:
 *
 *  - TEXT SCROLLED OUT OF A CLIPPING ANCESTOR PAINTS NOTHING. Three boxes here
 *    clip live text: `.hex-output`, capped at 8rem (6rem on a phone) around
 *    generator output; `.modal-content`, capped at 80vh around the KAT and
 *    ABOUT dialogs; and `.table-scroll`, the wrapper each statistics table
 *    sits in, whose cells are all `white-space: nowrap`. Content scrolled past any of them is not dimmed or partly drawn:
 *    it is absent from the frame, and asking what colour it sits on has no
 *    answer. Its rect is still outside every ancestor's box, so the ancestor
 *    walk would find nothing behind it, fall through to white, and invent a
 *    failure. Skip it, and rely on the content that IS in view, which is
 *    measured for real.
 *
 *  - TRANSPARENT TEXT PAINTS NOTHING. Anything drawn `color: transparent` lays
 *    no ink down; compositing a zero-alpha foreground just returns the backdrop
 *    and reports a fixed 1:1. There is no contrast requirement on ink that is
 *    never laid down.
 *
 *  - SVG PAINTS IN DOCUMENT ORDER, SO SIBLINGS CAN BE THE BACKGROUND. This lab
 *    has no SVG text — its only SVG is the shared header's hamburger and GitHub
 *    marks, both `aria-hidden` and glyph-free — so the sibling walk finds
 *    nothing to do. It is kept because the alternative is a helper that silently
 *    mismeasures the first labelled diagram anyone adds: an ancestor-only walk
 *    would composite a `<text>` onto the `<svg>`'s own transparent background
 *    rather than onto the `<rect>` drawn under it, and report a ratio nothing on
 *    screen has.

     * on average, which moves a 4.5:1 pair by well under 0.05 — but it is a
     * real difference between what this gate measures and what that reader

     *
     * The sampler is kept for the ordinary gradient case: `paintAt` has to
     * decide what a `background-image` layer contributes, and the alternative
     * default — treat every layer as transparent — is silently wrong the moment
     * anyone gives a panel or the progress bar a gradient. The walk would then
     * composite the text onto the surface BEHIND the gradient and report a
     * ratio nothing on screen has, in the direction that hides failures.

     * Sampling, rather than judging a gradient at its worst stop: a stop-worst
     * reading assumes the worst stop covers the text wherever the text sits,

     * real ratio against `--bg-primary` (#0a0a0f) is 5.63:1: nine invented
     * failures on the first scan, describing a white page that does not exist.
     *
     * So the canvas is composited under whatever the ancestor walk accumulated,
